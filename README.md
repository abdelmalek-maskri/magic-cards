# Magic Cards Game

This is a simple memory game built with React where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The goal is to match all pairs with the least number of turns.

## Features

- **Shuffle Cards:** Every new game shuffles the cards to provide a unique experience each time.
- **Track Turns:** The game tracks the number of turns taken by the player.
- **Matching Logic:** Players must match pairs of cards. Once a match is found, the cards remain flipped.

## Usage
### Starting a New Game

- Click on the **New Game** button to shuffle the deck and reset the game.
- Select any two cards by clicking on them to reveal their images.
- If the images on the two selected cards match, the cards remain face-up.

### Game Rules

- **Flipping Cards:** You can flip two cards at a time.
- **Matching Pairs:** If the flipped cards match, they stay face-up; otherwise, they flip back after a short delay.
